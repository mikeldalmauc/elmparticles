{-| So, let's break down what we've got: this emoji is a cone bursting stuff
towards the upper right (you can see it at `tada.png` in the repo.) We have:

  - little brightly-colored squares. Looks like they can spin!
  - longer, wavy, brightly-colored streamers (but we'll just use rectangles here)

Let's model those as a custom type!
